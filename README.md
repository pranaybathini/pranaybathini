# Hey, I'm Pranay 👋

### Senior Software Engineer @ Booking.com

Building real-time streaming systems at scale (millions of events/day).

I write about AI, System design, Java, and distributed systems with a bias toward what breaks, what scales, and what actually matters in production.

## About

At Booking.com, I work on infrastructure that processes millions of events daily. Previously built streaming solutions with Apache Flink for real-time safety incident detection. Before that, worked at Lowe's and Paytm Payments Bank on distributed systems.

I write about what I learn on AI, System design patterns, Java internals, Spring Boot, and distributed systems.

I started writing because most resources felt either too academic or too shallow. I wanted something that helps you reason about real systems, not just memorize patterns.

## 💭 Currently Thinking About

- LLMs in production beyond demos (evaluation, cost, failure modes)
- How code review changes when AI writes 90% of the code and reducing AI slop
- Teaching system design without turning it into pattern memorization
